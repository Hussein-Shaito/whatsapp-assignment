## Assignment Details
A class named chat_details.dart, there is a Center widget in it, that says 'Assignment goes here'.

In this assignment you need to cover the following points:
- Connect the app to Firestore, there is a clear documentation by google.
- Create a TextField and a button send to send a message.
- Upon sending the message we need to store it on Firestore.
- A stream that listens to the changes on Firestore and list the chats on the screen.
- On long click should give an option to the user to either edit/delete the message.
- On edit message will be updated on Firestore.
- On delete message will be deleted from Firestore.

Note:
- No need to have a great UI, keep the UI simple as much as possible, care more
for the logic on how to CRUD from Firestore.
- Also no need to make it a chat 1 to 1 (sender and recipient) app, only a sender is ok.
- A lot of examples you can find through googling, do not hesitate to use and understand any example you find.

Bonus:
- Good UI.
- Good coding structure.
- Ability to send Image with Firestore CRUD operations.
- Use state management like states_rebuilder in flutter or Porvider
- Make it work with android and ios devices
